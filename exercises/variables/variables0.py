'''
In python, there is no need to declare the variable type or class type
before assigning values.
'''
# You have seen this example in the last exercise:

x = 5
# Note that when you are done, you don't need to add semicolon :)

# In General
# variable_name = value

'''
There are primarily four primative data types 
(as well as other built-in data types)
  Integers
  Float
  Strings
  Boolean
 '''
# This is an integer
x = 6

# This is a float
num = 6.0

# This is a boolean
bol = True # (The first letter of True or False need to be capitalized)

# And this is a string
str = "Hello World 123!"

#This is also a string
another_str = 'Hello World 123!' 
# (In python, double quotation mark and single 
# quotation mark can both used to carry string message)
